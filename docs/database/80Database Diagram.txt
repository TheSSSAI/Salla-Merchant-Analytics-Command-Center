This ER diagram illustrates the denormalized fact tables for the SaaS Platform's OLAP data warehouse, built on ClickHouse. It includes 'SalesFact' for sales analytics and 'AbandonedCartFact' for cart abandonment analysis. As these are wide, denormalized tables optimized for analytical performance, they are presented as separate entities without direct relational links, reflecting their independent roles in the data warehouse.
