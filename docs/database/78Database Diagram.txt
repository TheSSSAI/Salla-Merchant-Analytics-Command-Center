This Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) visualizes the database schema for a multi-tenant sales analytics platform. The core of the model revolves around the `MerchantAccount` entity, which acts as the central tenant, isolating data for products, customers, sales, and analytics. The `User` entity manages authentication and can be associated with multiple merchant accounts via the `UserMerchantAccount` join table, enabling team-based access control with different roles.

The diagram illustrates key data flows, including sales transactions (`SalesOrder`, `OrderItem`), customer management (`Customer`), product cataloging (`Product`, `Category`), and user engagement features like abandoned cart recovery (`AbandonedCart`) and invitations (`Invitation`). It also includes entities for supporting functions such as compliance (`DataSubjectRequest`), security (`AuditLog`), and user-specific settings (`UserPreference`). The relationships clearly define the cardinality and dependencies between these components.
