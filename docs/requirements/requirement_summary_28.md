# Software Requirements Specification: Salla Merchant Analytics Command Center

## 1.0 Project Goal
The primary goal is to build an analytics system for Salla e-commerce <<$Change>>merchants<<$Change>>. This system will serve as a <<$Change>>command center<<$Change>>, providing them with full <<$Change>>visibility<<$Change>> for <<$Change>>managing their<<$Change>> sales and ongoing business operations.

#### Enhancement Justification
*   **Reasoning**: Corrected several spelling and grammatical errors ("merchnets", "comand", "visability", "manageing", "there") to improve the clarity and professionalism of the core project statement. The functional goal remains identical.

## 2.0 Key Features

### 2.1 Deep Analytics
The system must provide deep analytics capabilities. <<$Addition>>(Examples include, but are not limited to: sales trend analysis, customer segmentation, conversion rate optimization funnels, product performance reports, and sales forecasting.)<<$Addition>>

#### Enhancement Justification
*   **Reasoning**: The original term "deep analytics" is ambiguous. Adding concrete examples provides a clear, actionable scope for development, ensures key functionalities are included, and prevents scope creep.

### 2.2 AI Assistant
The system will include an AI <<$Change>>Assistant<<$Change>>. <<$Addition>>(This assistant should leverage technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide data-driven insights, answer natural language queries about sales data, and suggest automated actions to improve store performance.)<<$Addition>>

#### Enhancement Justification
*   **Reasoning**: Corrected a spelling error ("assitant"). The addition clarifies the technical approach and expected capabilities of the AI feature, transforming a vague concept into a well-defined and testable requirement.

### 2.3 Cart Recovery
The system must feature a cart <<$Change>>recovery<<$Change>> module. <<$Addition>>(This includes functionality to track abandoned shopping carts and trigger automated follow-up actions, such as customized emails or push notifications, to encourage customers to complete their purchase.)<<$Addition>>

#### Enhancement Justification
*   **Reasoning**: Corrected a spelling error ("recovary"). The added text defines the core functionality of the cart recovery system, making the requirement specific and actionable for the development team.

## 3.0 Target Users
The primary target users for this system are e-commerce <<$Change>>merchants<<$Change>> using the Salla platform.

#### Enhancement Justification
*   **Reasoning**: Corrected a spelling error ("merchents") for clarity.

## 4.0 Non-Functional Requirements (Technology Preferences)

### 4.1 Architecture
The system architecture must be <<$Change>>scalable<<$Change>> to handle growing data volumes and user loads.

#### Enhancement Justification
*   **Reasoning**: Corrected a spelling error ("scalble").

### 4.2 Performance
The application must be <<$Change>>fast<<$Change>>. <<$Addition>>(As a target, key user interactions and API response times should be under 200ms under typical load conditions.)<<$Addition>>

#### Enhancement Justification
*   **Reasoning**: The term "fast" is subjective. Adding a quantifiable performance metric (e.g., <200ms) transforms this into a specific, measurable, and testable non-functional requirement.

### 4.3 Platform Support
The application must be delivered as a Progressive Web App (PWA) to ensure accessibility across devices and provide an app-like experience.

## 5.0 Design Requirements

### 5.1 UI Component Library
The user interface is to be built using the <<$Change>>shadcn/ui<<$Change>> component library.

#### Enhancement Justification
*   **Reasoning**: Corrected a typo ("chadin ui") to specify the correct and intended UI component library. This is a critical detail for the front-end development team.
