### **Project Summary: Salla Merchant Analytics Command Center**

This document outlines the requirements for an advanced analytics and business management platform designed specifically for Salla e-commerce merchants. The system's core purpose is to serve as a centralized "command center," offering merchants comprehensive visibility and control over their sales and business operations.

#### **Core Functional Requirements**

The platform will be built around three key features:

*   **Deep Analytics**: The system will offer robust analytical tools. This includes, but is not limited to, sales trend analysis, customer segmentation, product performance reporting, and sales forecasting to empower merchants with actionable data.
*   **AI Assistant**: An integrated AI-powered assistant will provide intelligent insights. Merchants will be able to ask natural language questions about their business data and receive suggestions for optimizing their store's performance.
*   **Cart Recovery**: A dedicated module will be implemented to track and recover abandoned shopping carts. This feature will use automated follow-ups like emails and notifications to help merchants reclaim lost sales.

#### **Target Audience**

*   The exclusive users of this platform are **e-commerce merchants** operating on the Salla platform.

#### **Technical and Design Specifications**

The system must adhere to the following non-functional and design requirements:

*   **Scalable Architecture**: The underlying infrastructure must be designed to scale efficiently, accommodating growth in data and user traffic without performance degradation.
*   **High Performance**: The application must be fast and responsive. A key performance indicator (KPI) is to maintain API and user interaction response times below 200ms under normal operating conditions.
*   **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: The application will be developed as a PWA, ensuring a seamless, installable, and app-like experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **UI/UX Design**: The user interface will be constructed using the **shadcn/ui** component library to ensure a modern, consistent, and high-quality user experience.
