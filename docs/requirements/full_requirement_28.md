Its contents regarding deployment environments and client-side requirements were previously consolidated into REQ-OVR-001, making this requirement redundant and contradictory. This action solidifies the Vercel-first serverless architecture as the single source of truth.\n\n---\n\n### **Original Text (for historical reference)**\n\nThe system shall be deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).\nThe project shall maintain three separate environments: Development, Staging, and Production.\nThe system shall not have specific end-user hardware requirements beyond a modern web browser.\nThe client-side application shall require a modern, evergreen web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).\n\n---\n\n### **Formalized Text**\n\nN/A (Requirement has been removed).",
