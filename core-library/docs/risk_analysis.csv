"RISK-001","Technical","Serverless execution timeout during historical data synchronization (12-24 month depth) on Vercel platform due to strict execution limits (10s-60s).","5","5","25","Critical","WI-DATA-001 (Historical Data Import Background Job)","Vercel serverless function limits combined with potentially large Salla datasets and API pagination requirements.","Implement recursive job chaining using Upstash QStash. Use a cursor-based pagination system where each function execution processes one batch and enqueues the next.","Migration of the sync worker to a long-running container service (e.g., AWS Fargate or Railway) if serverless orchestration proves too fragile.","Vercel Function Timeout errors (504) or QStash failure notifications exceeding 5% rate.","Backend Lead","2023-11-10","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Security","Data leakage between tenants during AI RAG queries where the LLM might retrieve or halluncinate context from a different merchant.","3","5","15","High","WI-AI-002 (Implement RAG Query Service)","Improper filtering in the vector database retrieval layer or prompt injection vulnerabilities allowing SQL manipulation.","Enforce strict row-level security (RLS) or mandatory 'merchant_id' filter in every Prisma/Vector query before data reaches the LLM context window. Use a read-only database user for AI SQL generation.","Disable NLQ (Natural Language Query) features and revert to pre-defined report templates until security patch.","Detection of cross-tenant ID patterns in generated SQL logs via Axiom.","Security Architect","2023-11-20","In Progress"
"RISK-003","Quality","Data drift and inconsistency between the OLTP (PostgreSQL) and OLAP (ClickHouse) databases causing inaccurate analytics reports.","4","4","16","High","WI-OLAP-002 (Postgres to ClickHouse Pipeline), WI-REP-001 (Analytics API)","Latency in the batch ingestion pipeline or failure to handle update/delete events correctly in the append-only OLAP model.","Implement a 'ReplacingMergeTree' engine in ClickHouse to handle updates. Create a nightly reconciliation job that verifies checksums between Postgres and ClickHouse.","Implement a 'Force Resync' button for admins to truncate and reload merchant data from Postgres to ClickHouse.","Data freshness metric (lag) exceeding 10 minutes in the analytics dashboard.","Data Engineer","2023-11-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","External","Salla API rate limiting triggering 429 errors during initial bulk onboarding of multiple merchants simultaneously.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-DATA-001 (Import Job), WI-DATA-002 (Webhook Handler)","Aggressive parallel fetching logic without respecting external API concurrency constraints.","Implement an exponential backoff strategy with jitter in the QStash worker configuration. Utilize Salla's response headers to dynamically throttle requests.","Throttle onboarding throughput by implementing a waitlist system for new merchant data syncing.","Salla API error rate > 1% in 1 hour window.","Integration Specialist","2023-11-05","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","Performance degradation of ClickHouse queries for large merchants due to suboptimal schema partitioning or indexing.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-OLAP-001 (ClickHouse Schema), WI-REP-003 (Detailed Reports)","Incorrect choice of partition keys or sorting keys for the specific query patterns (filtering by date vs. filtering by product).","Perform load testing with generated data (1M+ rows) to validate schema. Use materialized views for common aggregate queries (e.g., Daily Sales).","Refactor schema to use coarser partitions or add secondary indices (Projection) for slow queries.","p95 Query Latency > 300ms for analytical endpoints.","Database Architect","2023-11-25","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","Email deliverability failure for Cart Recovery due to domain verification issues or IP reputation.","2","4","8","Medium","WI-REC-003 (Email Sender)","Lack of proper DKIM/SPF setup for merchant custom domains or shared IP blacklisting.","Enforce domain verification UI flow before enabling email features. Use Postmark's dedicated IP options if volume justifies it.","Fallback to system-default domain for sending critical notifications if custom domain fails.","Bounce rate > 5% on Postmark dashboard.","DevOps Engineer","2023-12-01","Not Started"
