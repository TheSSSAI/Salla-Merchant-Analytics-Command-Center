"RISK-001","Technical","Latency or failure in the Change Data Capture (CDC) pipeline between PostgreSQL (OLTP) and ClickHouse (OLAP) leading to stale analytics data exceeding the 5-minute freshness requirement.","4","5","20","High","WI-004, WI-009, WI-010, WI-011","Complexity of maintaining consistency between row-based and column-based stores in a serverless environment without a persistent CDC process.","Implement Upstash QStash for reliable message queuing with automatic retries. Use idempotent event processing logic in the consumer function.","Develop a scheduled 'reconciliation' cron job (WI-008 extension) that performs a nightly full-sync check to correct data drift.","Queue depth in Upstash exceeding 1000 events or 'event_age' metric exceeding 300 seconds.","Lead Backend Engineer","2023-11-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","Strict API rate limiting from Salla during historical data synchronization (WI-008) causing job failures or incomplete data imports for large merchants.","5","4","20","High","WI-006, WI-008","External dependency on Salla API constraints which may not align with the throughput required for bulk historical fetching.","Implement a 'Token Bucket' rate limiter using Upstash Redis. Design the sync worker to respect 'Retry-After' headers and implement exponential backoff.","Implement a 'Resume Sync' capability that stores pagination cursors in the database, allowing jobs to restart from the last successful page after a timeout.","Salla API responding with HTTP 429 status codes > 5% of requests.","Integration Specialist","2023-11-10","In Progress"
"RISK-003","Operational","Serverless function cold starts causing timeouts for Salla Webhooks (WI-007), resulting in unacknowledged events and potential data loss if Salla stops retrying.","4","4","16","High","WI-007, WI-009","Vercel serverless functions have a strict timeout window, and initializing DB connections or complex logic inside the handler can exceed this.","Decouple webhook ingestion from processing. The webhook handler should ONLY verify the signature, push to QStash, and return 200 OK immediately.","Enable Vercel 'Function Warming' for critical webhook paths during anticipated high-traffic periods.","Webhook endpoint response time (p95) exceeding 800ms.","DevOps Architect","2023-11-05","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Security","Multi-tenant data leakage where a user accesses data belonging to another merchant due to improper RBAC enforcement or SQL query parameterization errors.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-005, WI-010, WI-011","Manual enforcement of 'merchant_id' filters in custom API routes and complex SQL queries instead of using RLS or ORM middleware.","Implement a global middleware that attaches the validated 'merchant_id' to the request context. Use Zod schema validation to enforce tenant IDs on all DB queries.","Immediate rollback of deployment. Execute legal notification protocols (GDPR/CCPA). Trigger audit log review to identify affected records.","Detection of queries returning data where 'merchant_id' does not match the authenticated user token (via Audit Logs).","Security Lead","2023-11-20","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","Database connection exhaustion in serverless environment when connecting to PostgreSQL or ClickHouse under load.","4","4","16","High","WI-003, WI-004, WI-010","Serverless functions open a new connection per invocation, rapidly depleting database connection limits.","Mandatory use of connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer or Supabase Transaction Pool) for Postgres. Use HTTP interface for ClickHouse to avoid persistent TCP connection limits.","Scale up database instance connection limits temporarily while optimizing query patterns.","Database 'max_connections' errors in Sentry logs.","Database Architect","2023-11-01","In Progress"
"RISK-006","External","OpenAI RAG implementation (WI-016) suffering from high latency (>5s) or hallucinations, rendering the AI Assistant feature unusable.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-015, WI-016","Dependency on external API latency and the probabilistic nature of LLMs processing complex analytics queries.","Implement strict prompt engineering with few-shot examples. Cache common queries in Redis. Implement a circuit breaker pattern.","Fallback to a deterministic 'suggested queries' UI if the AI service is degraded or too slow.","AI Service response time p95 > 3000ms or negative user feedback rate > 10%.","AI Engineer","2023-12-01","Not Started"
